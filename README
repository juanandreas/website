Lex.java = The main program that takes data from input files, sorts it, and prints into an output file.
Makefile = creates jar file for Lex.java


-compile by typing 'make'
-clean class files by typing 'make clean'

Comments:
Some command lines are commented out, I want to keep them there because it helped me trace out Lex.java while debugging. THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM FUNCTION.
